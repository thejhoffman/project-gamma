I am working on the edit button for the calendar page to allow a logged-in user to edit the event that was created. I also plan to look into more front-end design ideas to improve the calendar and events form page.

Morning: Yesterday, I worked on the EventForm. I used React hooks for this. Today, I will continue to edit the eventform and also create a unit test. Today, we learned about unit tests and how to write our own. I will write a unit test for one of the endpoints I created.
Evening: I finished creating the EventForm, I utilized react hooks and learned how to use authorization to ensure the logged-in users can only see the people they added. I also assisted in editing the events queries to incorporate Person name/id and Occasion name/id. This involved editing the SQL tables and functions. I also completed the Calendar list, which will show the upcoming events for the logged-in users. This also included working with authorization to make sure the logged-in users only see the events they created. I also finished creating the unit tests for the interests endpoints.

Last week, we worked collaboratively to create a wireframe design for our project. We each brought unique perspectives and ideas to fulfill our vision for this application. We also began creating API endpoints and incorporating them with our specific project. I wrote API endpoints for getting an event, updating an event, and deleting an event. We also incorporated authorization tokens into our endpoints.
